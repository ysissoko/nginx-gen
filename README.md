# **NginxGen**  
*A Simple, Dynamic Nginx Configuration File Generator*

NginxGen is a utility built with Plop.js that generates dynamic Nginx reverse proxy configuration files for multiple applications. It allows you to quickly set up reverse proxies, assign subdomains, and enable SSL certificates, all based on your input.

---

## **Features**
- Generate reverse proxy configurations for multiple applications.
- Assign unique subdomains to each application.
- Support for SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt or custom).
- Automatic redirection from HTTP to HTTPS.
- Easily customizable templates for your specific needs.

---

## **Prerequisites**
1. **Node.js** installed on your system.
2. **Nginx** installed and configured to use the generated configuration file.
3. SSL certificates (e.g., from Let's Encrypt) for your subdomains.

---

## **Installation**
Clone or download this repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nginxgen.git
cd nginxgen
```

---

## **Usage**

1. Run the generator using Plop.js:
```bash
npx plop
```

2. Follow the prompts to configure your Nginx file:
    - The input data filename with your servers configurations

3. After completing the prompts, the configuration file will be generated at:
   ```
   output/nginx.conf
   output/config
   ```

4. Move the generated `output/nginx.conf` file to your Nginx configuration directory (e.g., `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`):
   ```bash
   sudo mv output/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/your-config.conf
   ```
5. Move the generated `output/conf` file to your ssh configuration folder (e.g., `~/.ssh`):
   ```bash
   sudo mv output/config ~/.ssh/config
   ```

6. Test and reload Nginx:
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```
   
---

## **Customization**

The generator uses Handlebars templates located in the `plop-templates/` directory. To modify the default behavior:
1. Edit the `nginx-config.hbs` or `ssh-config.hbs` files to change how the configuration is generated.
2. Customize SSL settings, HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection, or other directives as needed.

## **Example**

Hereâ€™s an example input:
- **Server details**:
   ```json
    [
        {
            "name": "app1",
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": "3001",
            "domain": "app1.mansadev.com",
            "cert": {
                "certFilepath": "path/to/cert/fullchain.pem",
                "privKeyFilepath": "path/to/privkey/privatekey.pem"
            },
            "deployment": {
                "privKeyFilename": "app1_key",
                "repo": "app1",
                "owner": "owner"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "app2",
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": "3002",
            "domain": "app2.mansadev.com",
            "cert": {
                "certFilepath": "path/to/cert/fullchain.pem",
                "privKeyFilepath": "path/to/privkey/privatekey.pem"
            },
            "deployment": {
                "privKeyFilename": "app2_key",
                "repo": "app1",
                "owner": "owner"
            }
        }
    ]
   ```

Generated output:
```nginx
http {
    upstream app1 {
        server 127.0.0.1:3001;
    }

    upstream app2 {
        server 127.0.0.1:3002;
    }

    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name app1.yourdomain.com;
        ssl_certificate /path/to/your/app1/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/app1/privkey.pem;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://app1;
        }
    }

    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name app2.yourdomain.com;
        ssl_certificate /path/to/your/app2/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/app2/privkey.pem;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://app2;
        }
    }
}
```

# GitHub Deploy Key Manager

This script automates the generation and addition of deploy keys for GitHub repositories based on a provided JSON configuration file. It ensures each repository has a secure deploy key, avoiding duplicates where possible. The script is automatically executed by the `plop.js` file which defines an action to execute it after the config files generation.

## Features

- Reads a JSON configuration file to extract deployment details.
- Generates new SSH keys if they do not already exist.
- Adds public keys as deploy keys to the specified GitHub repositories via the GitHub API.
- Skips adding deploy keys if they already exist for the repository.

## Prerequisites

1. **Environment Setup**:  
   Create a `.env` file in the same directory as the script with the following content:
   ```bash
   export GH_TOKEN=<your_github_personal_access_token>

# Wildcard Subdomain TLS Certificate Generator

The script script generates a wildcard TLS certificate for a specified subdomain using Certbot with DNS challenge verification.

## Usage

```bash
    chmod +x ./gen_certs.sh
    sudo ./gen_certs.sh <subdomain>
```

## Prerequisites
- The script installs certbot and python3-certbot-nginx if they are not already installed.
- You must have access to configure DNS records for the domain to complete the DNS challenge.
